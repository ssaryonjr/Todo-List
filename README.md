<b>Technologies & Tools Utilized:</b> React, JavaScript, CSS3.</b> This application is a Todo List Tracker that is both Desktop and Mobile web friendly. Built in React on the frontend allowing very fast UI changes.

- I followed along the directions by first using Postman to test the API endpoint.
- I created a login component that validates all criterias are matched before creating a `POST` request to endpoint.
- Once access granted users are allowed to add, delete, edit and track their task that will remain available in their browsers `local storage`.

## Lessons Learned
- The project was straight forward and very easy. My biggest hurdle was in the beginning creating the Login component and validating that every criteria was met successfully. I spent more time building the login component than I did on the main page. Another lesson I learned was managing my time well to get everything done in a feasible time while keeping up with work and other responsibilities. I'd say in total I spent about 4-5 hours working on this project and adding finishing touches.

## Installation: 
1. Clone repository
2. `cd frontend`
3. `npm start`



## Future Optimizations:
- If I had more time I would refactor a lot of code. My approach is alwayes to get things up and running first and later go back and optimize.
